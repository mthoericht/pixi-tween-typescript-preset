# Pixi.js Game-Boilerplate

![pixi.js logo](https://pixijs.download/pixijs-banner-no-version.png?v=1)

## Description
This is a simple template/boilerplate for implementing a slot game using TypeScript 5.7 , Pixi 7.3 and GSAP 3.12.

## How it works
1. install Node.JS 22 (LTS)
2. clone this repo
3. run these scripts (defined in package.json)
   1. `npm run clean-setup`
   2. `npm run build`
   3. `npm run start`
4. now you should see the preset on your default-browser

## Documentations
- TypeScript https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
- PIXIJS - https://pixijs.download/v7.x/docs/index.html
- GSAP - https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/

## Commands

- `npm run setup` - install all npm libraries/dependencies
- `npm run clean-setup` - remove the node_modules-folder (if available) & install all npm libraries/dependencies
- `npm run build` - starts build procedure
- `npm run start` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8081
- `npm run lint` - generate code coverage report


# Docker as alternative
Start in the root-directory of this repo ... the place with `Dockerfile` and `README.md`.\
First, and needed only once, build the container in the shell (e.g. bash) - from the directory with the Dockerfile:\
`docker build --tag 'pixi-test' .`\
(Install buildx according to your OS, check: https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/ and then execute: `docker buildx install`)

Now run the container and map the container-internal port 8080 to an unused port on your localhost/127.0.0.1 (e.g. 8080, 8081, ...), and also map the directory with the git-repo into the docker-container under /home/developer:\
`docker run -it -p <desired localhost-port>:8080 -v "$(pwd)":/home/developer pixi-test`

Now the user should be in a bash-shell within the container in the working-directory "/home/developer".\
Also, with the directory-mapping, any changes in the files will be reflected in the computers filesystem and also in the containers filesystem under /home/developer.

Within the container and under /home/developer you can now run the npm-steps to set the game up:
* `npm run clean-setup`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run start` - after that, npm monitors the files, any (external) file-changes will trigger a new build, which can be (re)loaded into the game under http://localhost:8080
